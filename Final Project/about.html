			<p>Welcome to Project Olympus, a simple Star Trek game based on designing your own starship based on the ones we all know and love. Pick from the most iconic ships of Star Trek, from Captain Kirk's Constitution class starship to Captain Sisko's Defiant escort. </p>
			<p>With the hull selected now you can change whatever you want about the ship, its shields, weapons, to how many holodecks you have on your ship. Changing each of these will effect the stats of your ship, but that's the point, build the ship how you want it, to do what you want it to do.</p>
